## Problem Description
The problem we are going to solve is designing a robot using sensor to go through a maze successfully. The robot has four actions: move one-step forward, turn left, turn right and stay still. The robot also has six sensors: front Sensor, front-left Sensor, front-right Sensor, left Sensor, right Sensor and back Sensor.
